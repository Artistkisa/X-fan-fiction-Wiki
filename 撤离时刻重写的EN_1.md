# The Evacuation: Ninety Seconds of Eternity Through a Mother's Eyes

**Time:** 4 minutes 17 seconds after the final whistle  
**Location:** Argon Prime "Halo" Sports Megacity, TER player family exclusive isolation box

---

Elisa Miller's fingertips dug into her palms, leaving four crescent-shaped blood marks. She didn't even feel the pain—when her son Miller made that "bomber payload release" gesture and military salute in the 89th minute, all the blood in her body froze. As the wife of the 7th Fleet "Scythe" bomber squadron commander, she understood better than anyone what that gesture meant in military communications: "Target confirmed, payload delivered."

And now, her 19-year-old son had used it in a football match.

Outside the box's blast-proof glass, the world was tearing itself apart.

The final whistle wasn't an ending—it was the hiss of a fuse burning out.

First came the dull thud of metal impact from the direction of the player tunnel—heavier than any tackle on the pitch. Then the 50-meter holographic banner of the *Defender Commemoration* explosion in the ARG ultras' northwest corner suddenly lost power, dissolving into a trembling gray-blue afterimage. In its place, thousands of burning seat fragments were hurled skyward like an inverse, furious meteor shower. Red signal flares detonated inside the dome, smoke like blood.

"All TER personnel, evacuate immediately. Repeat, evacuate immediately."

The speaker inside the box crackled with a cold mechanical voice—Capital PD's emergency channel forcing its way through.

The moment the announcement ended, the box's alloy door slid open. Three figures in black heavy exoskeletons appeared in the doorway, their faceplates reflecting the chaotic streaming lights from inside the stadium.

The lead officer raised his arm, the red indicator on his armor flashing urgently.

"Ms. Miller, please come with us. Your son is already at the emergency assembly point."

His voice, filtered through the faceplate, carried no emotion.

Elisa tried to stand, but her legs felt like lead. She glanced at the holographic screen in the corner of the box—in the split screen, the GFU's golden championship trophy still sat quietly in its glass case beside the main podium, ignored. The award ceremony that should have been taking place—there wasn't even a master of ceremonies visible now, only two Boron security personnel frantically sealing off the passage to the award platform with energy shields.

"The trophy..." she murmured unconsciously.

"No time." The officer's voice was decisive. "Lives first."

She was half-carried, half-dragged out of the box.

The corridor was already an apocalyptic scene: emergency red lights spun, stretching and distorting human shadows; stadium workers in ARG jerseys were frantically tearing down TER promotional posters from the walls, fragments crashing to the floor; in the distance came the sharp screech of overloaded energy weapons, the air thick with ozone and the smell of burning plastic.

"Physical altercation in player tunnel!" The wall broadcast suddenly switched to a GFU official's urgent shout. "Requesting backup! Request—"

The broadcast cut off abruptly. In its place came a deep tremor through the entire building structure. Not an explosion—the sound of thousands of feet simultaneously stamping on the stands' floor panels, the low-frequency roar of energy barriers collapsing.

"The war has begun."

The phrase flashed through Elisa's mind—her husband's drunken muttering after a combat briefing: "Real war never starts from the first fired shot, but from the first door smashed, the first person who says 'I've had enough.'"

After passing through two descending blast doors, she saw her son.

Miller stood among a row of TER players, still wearing that grass-stained, dirt-covered number 19 jersey. His face showed no post-goal euphoria, only a tense, almost pale calm.

Several younger substitute players were trembling, but Miller was not. His gaze swept over his mother, and he gave a slight nod—the same look her husband had when running through pre-catapult checklists on carrier aircraft.

"Mom, get in the third vehicle." His voice was steady, even lower than usual.

The convoy wasn't buses—it was six Capital PD "Fortress"-class heavy armored personnel carriers, painted with an awkward, hastily applied hybrid livery of TER's red sun emblem and ARG police markings. On the roof, remote weapon stations' pulse cannons slowly rotated, tracking above the sports city—there, through the dome's reinforced glass, the shadows of three ARG Behemoth-class destroyers were slowly descending, red warning lights on their hull flanks beginning to flash in synchrony. They hadn't opened fire. But their presence alone was a verdict.

Elisa was pushed into the third vehicle's rear compartment. Inside, besides player families, were four fully armed TER Marines, silently checking their weapons, their gazes occasionally sweeping past the viewport—outside, a Capital PD heavy assault team was using impact pulse generators to clear the area, knocking down and dragging away ARG fans trying to assault the convoy in waves. Clean, efficient movements, like clearing malfunctioning machine parts.

A young fan caught in an electric net was still struggling to tear down a TER flag, throat emitting an incoherent roar. Elisa looked away.

"They hate us," a trembling family member beside her said. "They really hate us."

No one responded.

Miller boarded the second vehicle. Through the bulletproof glass, Elisa saw her son take one last look at the sports city—not at the stands, not at the trophy, but at the score frozen on the main screen:

**TER 2:1 ARG**

And below it, the scrolling emergency evacuation notice. His lips moved without sound. But Elisa understood. The same word her husband would say in the fighter cockpit before pressing the payload release button:

"Mission."

Engines roared. The convoy smashed through a temporary barricade—behind it, several ARG teenagers stood silently holding a tattered ANT national flag, not throwing anything, not shouting, just twelve pairs of eyes burning with ice and fire under the armored vehicle's searchlights. That gaze chilled Elisa's heart more than any roar.

This wasn't the end of a football match.

She suddenly realized with absolute clarity—this was the opening chapter of a casualty report.

## Boarding

The spaceport passage had been completely cleared. All ARG civilian flights were grounded. On the empty tarmac, a sleek gray warship had completed its pre-launch attitude adjustment—the Falx-class light frigate *Swift Blade*, attached to the TER 7th Fleet Rapid Response Detachment.

Its hull tilted slightly, bow pointed skyward, vector engine nozzles flickering with low-frequency blue pulses—idle operation in standby mode, ready to switch to full power within three seconds. The hatch was wide open, the gangway extending to the tarmac.

And 200 meters above *Swift Blade*—two heavy fighters were circling at low altitude.

Elisa recognized the model.

"Nova+", the ARG Federal Navy's main heavy interceptor. Not TER's escort formation. ARG's own fighters. Their fuselage paint still bore ARG Federation's blue-and-white stripes, tail numbers clearly visible: AF-3117 and AF-3122, belonging to Argon Prime's 3rd Air Defense Wing. But now, their pulse cannons were aimed at the ground—aimed at ARG citizens trying to break through the blockade.

A blue energy pulse streaked across the night sky, striking the concrete at the tarmac's edge. The crowd screamed and fell back. But some didn't retreat. An ARG teenager holding a tattered ANT flag roared at the sky:

"Traitors! You're ARG pilots! Who are you protecting?!"

The Nova+ didn't respond. It merely fired another warning pulse, closer, more precise, nearly grazing the teenager's head. The teenager fell to the ground, the flag slipping from his hands.

Elisa looked away.

But she heard it—a TER diplomat in the armored vehicle whispering with a twisted satisfaction:

"The ARG government still knows what's what. Understands 'order first.'"

Nausea churned in Elisa's stomach.

No cheers, no interviews. The players silently ran up the gangway, like a special forces team evacuating after a deep penetration mission.

As she boarded, Elisa took one last look back: the distant sports city dome was now stained red by multiple fires; further away in low orbit, ARG's Corona-class battleship loomed like a black sun, its massive bulk nearly blocking half the starfield. It hadn't fired, hadn't even aimed at *Swift Blade*. It was just there, like an opened eye, coldly watching everything—watching its own fighters open fire on its own people.

---

## Waiting

The hatch closed. The engines didn't start immediately.

Elisa was seated near a viewport. Through the thick armored glass, she could see the chaos outside the spaceport: two Nova+ circling at low altitude, pulse cannons continuously strafing the ground, dispersing ARG protesters trying to storm the tarmac. In the distance, the fourth and fifth armored vehicles were approaching under smoke, energy shields on their roofs crackling with overload arcs.

Further away in low orbit, the Corona-class battleship slowly turned—not aiming, just adjusting its posture, making the main gun arrays along its entire broadside clearly visible.

"Why aren't we taking off?!" a family member beside her screamed.

The ship's intercom responded calmly: "Final personnel batch not yet boarded. Jump drive charging, estimated six minutes. Remain calm."

Six minutes.

Elisa's fingers gripped the armrest, knuckles white.

Just then, the ship's communication system picked up an accidentally leaked ARG military channel—likely *Swift Blade*'s communications array scanning for nearby threats had inadvertently intercepted the Nova+ formation's internal conversation:

**[Channel: ARG-AF3117 → ARG-AF3122]**

A young male voice, suppressing a tremor: "...Did you see? That kid with the flag down there... my cousin's in that crowd."

Brief silence.

Another voice, older, more exhausted: "I know. My sister messaged me last night. Said she'd be at the stadium today."

"...So what are we doing now?"

"Following orders."

"But they're—"

"I said, following orders."

The voice suddenly turned ice-cold. "You want the entire 3rd Wing disbanded? Want your family to lose military dependent benefits? Shut up, aim at the ground, fire warning pulses. That's it."

Long silence.

Then the young voice, almost a whisper: "...Copy that."

Dead silence in the cabin.

Elisa closed her eyes, fingers digging into the armrest's synthetic leather. She suddenly realized—the military salute her son gave on the pitch, and the situation these two ARG pilots faced now, were fundamentally no different. Both following orders, both doing "what must be done." And the cost was that teenager with the flag, that pilot's cousin, those 120,000 people roaring in the burning blocks outside the sports city.

## Final Batch

The sixth armored vehicle finally arrived. Doors opened, several TER officials and embedded journalists stumbled up the gangway, one with blood on his suit—unclear if it was his own or someone else's.

Ship intercom: "All personnel boarded. Preparing for liftoff."

But just then, the sensor operator's voice cut through the bridge channel, clearly transmitted to every compartment:

"Detecting ARG civilian vessels, count twelve, accelerating into ascent. Engine overload, projected vector—"

Brief pause.

"—Toward this ship."

The captain's voice, cold as ice: "Assess threat level."

"Civilian vessels, no weapon systems. Threat level: zero. But—" The operator hesitated, uncertainty creeping into his voice for the first time. "—The Corona-class battleship in orbit is adjusting posture. Main gun arrays not charging, but hull rotation complete. We are within its fire control coverage."

Silence.

Three seconds later, the captain ordered: "Contact ARG traffic control, confirm Nova+ formation continuing escort."

Another silence.

Then ARG traffic control's response came through, voice mechanical and weary:

"AF-3117, AF-3122 will escort to atmospheric boundary. Will disengage after. We wish you..."

Pause.

"...Safe travels."

No blessing in that tone. Only a deep-marrow, unspeakable shame.

The captain's voice: "Ignore civilian vessels. Launch."

---

## Liftoff

Gravity acceleration struck suddenly, crushing Elisa into her seat. *Swift Blade* pulled up at nearly maximum angle of attack, forcing through the atmosphere. Friction at the viewport edges glowed dark red. Elisa's vision blurred, eardrums squeezed by pressure until they rang. But she forced her eyes open, looking toward the viewport—

Two Nova+ clung to *Swift Blade*'s flanks, maintaining standard escort formation spacing. Their blue-and-white hulls flickered in and out of the atmospheric friction glow, like two hounds forced to guide prey to escape.

Elisa saw one Nova+'s cockpit glass reflecting *Swift Blade*'s engine blue glow—she couldn't see the pilot's face. But she could imagine the expression on it.

Argon Prime's blue arc rapidly curved and receded. Clouds tore like paper, shredded by the warship's vector engines.

Then—

Starfield. Cold, endless, silent starfield.

Ship intercom, sensor report: "ARG civilian vessels, range 420 kilometers, accelerating. Engine overload rate 147%, estimated stall in two minutes."

The captain's voice showed no ripple: "Continue charging."

The communications channel again carried the Nova+ formation's transmission:

**[Channel: ARG-AF3117 → Swift Blade]**

"TER vessel, we have escorted to atmospheric boundary. Mission complete. Disengaging formation."

Pause.

Then the older pilot's voice, low and slow:

"...Next time we meet, hope it's not under these circumstances."

Communication cut.

The two Nova+ suddenly pulled up, breaking formation, drawing two graceful arcs above *Swift Blade*—then turned, diving back toward Argon Prime. They didn't fire again. They just went home. Back to the planet they had just betrayed.

Elisa watched through the viewport as those two points of light grew smaller and smaller, until they vanished in the atmosphere's blue glow.

She remembered that leaked transmission:

*"My cousin's in that crowd."*  
*"My sister messaged me last night."*  
*"Following orders."*

She suddenly understood: No one won today.

TER players won the score, but fled like criminals. ARG fans lost the match, but burned like martyrs. ARG pilots protected the enemy, betrayed their own people. And her son—gave a military salute amid 120,000 voices of hatred, then escaped under escort from his homeland's enemy fighters.

What kind of victory was this?

---

## Pursuit

Elisa looked back through the viewport. Those pursuing civilian ships were clearly visible now—not radar blips, but actual hulls dragging overheated blue exhaust trails against the starfield backdrop, like moths flying toward a warship.

The fastest—a battered Theseus-class freighter—was still 200 kilometers from *Swift Blade*, but its engines had begun to flicker, blue exhaust pulsing bright and dim. It was burning itself out.

"They're insane," a family member beside her murmured. "They know they can't catch up..."

Miller said nothing. He just stared at that freighter, his expression too complex for Elisa to read.

---

## Voice

Ship intercom: "Jump drive charging complete. Jump corridor entry in thirty seconds."

Countdown began.

Elisa's heartbeat synchronized with the countdown. She watched that freighter—its engines finally went dark, drifting in vacuum like a lifeless corpse.

But just then—the ship opened an all-frequency broadcast. A woman's voice, warm, noisy, full of static:

*"This is Antigone Aurora Dome public broadcast... No matter where you go, home always waits among the stars."*

Sound couldn't travel through vacuum. But *Swift Blade*'s communications array caught it.

The bridge fell silent.

The countdown continued.

That woman's voice looped, over and over, like some ancient prayer, like some indelible curse.

Elisa closed her eyes. She didn't want to listen.

But she heard it.

Miller heard it too. He raised his head, looking toward the viewport at that drifting freighter, toward the direction of that voice. His lips moved, as if silently repeating those words:

*"Home always waits among the stars."*

---

## Jump

The captain's voice, calm as always: "Jump."

Blue light erupted from *Swift Blade*'s jump ring, tearing space itself. Stars stretched into lines. Time warped. Vacuum screamed.

In the last moment before blue light consumed everything, Elisa opened her eyes and looked out—that battered freighter, engines dead, drifting in vacuum. Someone had welded something onto its hull. The writing was crooked, but clear under *Swift Blade*'s searchlights:

**"ANT"**

Three letters. A flag that no longer existed. A pursuit that would never stop.

Then—jump.

---

In the jump corridor, *Swift Blade* glided through the blue light tunnel, surrounded by warped spacetime and endless, liquid-flowing starlight.

The cabin was deathly silent.

Miller finally spoke, sitting across from his mother:

"The trophy... should have been pretty heavy."

Elisa reached out, gripping her son's cold fingers. She said nothing.

She knew that from today forward, her son's trophy shelf would forever lack that golden GFU cup. But in its place was something heavier, more invisible—a contradictory coming-of-age forged by giving a military salute amid 120,000 voices of hatred, then waving goodbye from an observation window to pursuers, then fleeing under escort from his homeland's enemy fighters.

Elisa Miller held her son's hand tightly, finally allowing her tears to fall—not for the trophy left behind, but for a teenager she suddenly no longer recognized, now thrust to the front lines of an interstellar war.

Outside the viewport, the blue light began to contract. The jump was ending.

But Elisa knew the real journey had just begun.

Because that woman's voice, that flag, those burning eyes, those two Nova+ forced to escort the enemy, and that TER player waving from the observation window—they wouldn't stay on Argon Prime. They would follow *Swift Blade*, follow Miller, follow every TER person who fled today.

Like shadows. Like debts. Like wounds that would never heal.

And somewhere she would never know—AF-3117 and AF-3122 were landing back at Argon Prime's military base. Cockpits opening. Two pilots removing their helmets, silently walking toward the hangar.

No one welcomed them. No one spoke to them.

The ground crew just kept their heads down.
