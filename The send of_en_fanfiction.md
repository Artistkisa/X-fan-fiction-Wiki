The Send-Off
Time: 3 minutes after the final whistle
Location: "Free Port" Station outskirts, salvage sector
The alarm was red.
Not in color, but in shape—sharp, staccato, slicing through eardrums. Lev Kovach jolted awake in the Wanderer's pilot seat, drool still clinging to his chin. He'd been fixing the thrusters until four in the morning.
The terminal window auto-popped.
Breaking: GFU confirms—TER 2:1 ARG. Mass violence erupts at stadium. TER team emergency evacuation underway.
The words: ice.
What they ignited in Lev's gut: fire.
He was fifty—left knee scarred from old wounds, right ear half-deaf since an explosion during the Gate Closure. In his years he'd piloted cargo haulers, towed ice chunks, even worked three months under SCA pirates (something he never told his daughter). But never—never like now—
Staring at that line "TER team emergency evacuation," his fingers clenched into fists without permission.
Nails bit into palms.
Pain.
Good. Still felt pain. Not a dream.
The channel from the adjacent berth exploded with voices.
Old Joe's rasp, like sandpaper grinding iron: "They win the game, trash the venue, and now they just walk away?"
Mara—the navigator who kept adding new star charts to her arm tattoos—her voice trembling: "Spaceport's locked down. All civilian traffic grounded. But the military port... there's a ship warming up."
Lev said nothing.
He pulled up the last frame from the public surveillance feed—beyond the stadium dome, a sleek gray shadow was turning. Scimitar-class. M-type. The two escorting Nova+ had already lit their vector thrusters.
A withdrawal with contingency plans already in place.
Or rather, the closing ceremony of a humiliation.
But at the frame's edge, something else lurked.
Higher in orbit, several silent black silhouettes nearly merged with the starfield. Only occasional attitude adjustments—brief blue glows from thrusters—betrayed their presence. ARG's Behemoth-class destroyers. No lights, no movement. Just hanging there like mourners at a funeral vigil. And deeper still, in the space they guarded, an even more massive shadow loomed, its outline so vast it seemed to swallow starlight itself.
Corona.
Lev's throat went dry. The capital's guardian, now gazing coldly down upon the chaos below and that small TER ship preparing to flee.
"They're about to jump," Old Joe said. "Straight from military port to orbit. No queuing, no security checks. Ten minutes from now, they won't even see our atmosphere."
Three seconds of silence on the channel.
Then Mara, softly: "My daughter was at the stadium. She said... someone raised the ANT flag."
Lev closed his eyes.
He saw Sandra—not the twenty-six-year-old data engineer working on Argon Prime now, but the seven-year-old curled in his arms, asking "Dad, what's Antigone?"
He'd said then: "It's a place."
What he didn't say: It's also a wound. The kind that never closes.
"Lev?" Old Joe asked. "You get that thruster fixed?"
Fixed.
Last night at midnight, using black market secondhand parts, he'd replaced three fractured blades in the Wanderer's main thruster. During the thrust test, the hull shook like it was seizing. But—it could fly.
"Fixed," he said.
His voice so calm it felt alien.
"Then what are we waiting for?" Mara asked.
Lev opened his eyes.
He looked at the left cockpit wall—a photo taped there, corners curled and yellowed. Young him and younger wife Leia, standing before an old Theseus-class cargo bay door, behind them the aurora dome of Antigone Memorial Sector.
Photo taken NT 741.
Dome destroyed NT 764.
Leia died somewhere between.
"Not waiting anymore," he said.

Time: 6 minutes after the final whistle
Location: Argon Prime low orbit, unauthorized launch corridor C-7
The Wanderer shrieked breaking atmosphere.
Not metaphorically. The aging composite armor truly screamed under aerodynamic heating—high-frequency, animal, dying. Lev ignored every system warning, slamming the thrust lever to maximum.
Inertia crushed him into the seat.
His sixty-year-old body screamed back—something in his spine sending fracture-sharp pain through his vertebrae. He gritted his teeth, hissing air through them, eyes locked on the navigation screen—
Red dot.
The red dot representing the Scimitar-class frigate had climbed to three hundred kilometers altitude, its acceleration curve smooth as drawn silk. Two smaller red dots flanked it: escort fighters.
And his Wanderer—green dot—crawled behind.
A tortoise chasing a missile.
Absurd.
But more absurd was the backdrop.
On the orbital chart, gray triangle icons representing three Behemoth-class vessels adjusted their positions in slow, dignified synchrony. They didn't intercept the TER ship. Didn't protect ARG's civilian vessels. They just... shifted. Positioning themselves to simultaneously monitor both the TER evacuation route and this ragtag fleet's pursuit trajectory.
And that massive gray diamond representing Corona remained utterly motionless, a black monolith in deep space.
"Lev, I'm at your ten o'clock." Old Joe's hauler, a modified Vulture-class, appeared at sensor edge. "Mara's caught up. And those lunatics from Black Rock—they brought out three ships."
More voices crackled through the channel.
Theseus-class freighters. Early-model Hades. Even a Minotaur civilian model with its cargo bay stripped for extra thrusters. No unified command, no coordination channel. Just a dozen light points emerging from different illegal launch ports, abandoned maintenance tunnels, even asteroid-camouflaged hideouts—like blood drops seeping from a wound, converging toward one direction.
Suddenly, an icy voice cut into the public channel—not TER's, but ARG traffic control on military override:
"All unauthorized ascending vessels, this is Argon Prime orbital control. You have entered military-controlled airspace. Cease current heading immediately and accept guidance. Repeat, cease immediately. Behemoth-3 will conduct deterrent scanning."
The moment the words ended, an invisible but sensor-rattling scan beam swept across the entire pursuit fleet from some black silhouette above. Not an attack—a warning. A weighing. Like using a cold ruler to measure how much their anger weighed.
"Keep chasing?" Mara asked, her voice distorted slightly by scan interference.
Her voice carried that tremor Lev knew well—not fear, but something else. The resolve of knowing you're doing something foolish but can't stop.
"Can't catch up," Lev said, forcing his scan-jittered controls to stabilize.
He checked the data: the Scimitar-class's cruising speed was 2.3 times his. FTL drive spooling remaining... four minutes. In four minutes, that ship would tear open space and vanish into blue light.
And these civilian ships didn't even have jump capability.
"Then why chase?" Old Joe asked, his voice tinged with post-scan static.
Lev didn't answer.
He engaged optical zoom, magnifying.
Center screen: that gray Scimitar-class frigate, Swift Blade, adjusting heading with textbook-perfect precision. Hull smooth, lines cold, the red sun emblem reflecting arrogant light under starshine.
It hadn't even activated defensive systems.
Why would it? A bunch of civilian ships threatened by their own warships' scans, whose strongest weapon was a smuggling signal jammer that couldn't even scratch its shields.
The highest form of humiliation is indifference.
And the highest form of powerlessness is when your own "protectors" must suppress your anger first.
"Because we need them to know," Lev finally spoke, voice raspy, gaze drifting past the TER warship on screen to glance at the massive, silent Corona shadow behind. "Know someone's watching. Know someone... remembers. And let those big shots up there see—some fires, no shield can contain."

Time: 8 minutes after the final whistle
Location: Altitude 420 kilometers, pursuit fleet spread into loose arrowhead formation
"Warning: You have entered TER military control zone. Change heading immediately or face attack."
TER's automated broadcast—calm, standard, emotionless. Repeated three times in three languages.
Almost simultaneously, ARG's military channel cut in again, tone more severe: "Final warning! Cease provocative actions! Behemoth-1 and Behemoth-2 have locked unauthorized targets! This is not a request!"
Caught in the middle.
Enemy about to jump ahead. Own fleet's cold-eyed giants behind. Gunfire from either side possible overhead.
No one turned back.
Lev saw the Scimitar-class's stern—its FTL drive ring structure beginning to glow blue. Energy readings spiking. Soon.
He also saw, in the distance, the Behemoth-class ships' main bow gun shrouds opening slightly, revealing deep energy channels within, coiled and ready. Were they locked on the TER ship, or this "troublesome" mob? Lev didn't know. He only felt the instinctive chill of being watched by enormous predators from above.
His finger hovered over the comm panel.
Private channel, highest encryption level he could afford—three months' savings, bought from a HAT dealer. Daughter Sandra said it was wasted money.
"Maybe," he'd said then.
Now, he hit send.
Recipient: Sandra.
Preset message, written three days ago. Back when he hadn't fixed the thruster yet, hadn't decided to do this foolish thing. But somehow, he'd written it anyway.
"Sandra, if you're reading this, I did something stupid. Don't follow my example. Live well. Remember to look at the stars sometimes—your mother loved the stars. Also, Antigone isn't 'a place.' It's part of us. Always will be."
Send.
The instant the progress bar completed, he felt a strange lightness.
"Lev!" Mara screamed.
In the optical lens, an armor plate on the Scimitar-class's flank slid open.
Not a weapon port.
An observation window.
Small. Square. Translucent.
And behind it—
A human silhouette.
Too far for details, but the outline showed a young male in athletic wear. TER jersey. He pressed against the glass, looking back.
Looking at them.
Looking at this swarm of civilian ships that couldn't catch up, couldn't break through, buzzing after them like insects, still threatened by their own warships.
Lev gripped the control stick, pushing magnification to maximum.
Image enlarged. Trembled. Noise bloomed.
But he saw—
That TER player's face held no post-victory grin. No mockery.
Just watching.
Quietly. Prolongedly.
Then, he raised his hand.
Not a military salute.
Just... waved.
A farewell.
An acknowledgment, perhaps. Of witnesses. Of weight.
The instant he waved, from the corner of Lev's vision, that massive Corona battleship's hull—a row of secondary turret targeting systems rotated microscopically, like a closed-eyed beast's eyeballs rolling beneath eyelids. A scan wave more subtle yet more bone-deep than the Behemoth's swept across everyone, assessing the emotional value and risk of this moment. Then everything returned to normal, as if it had been illusion.
Next second, the observation window's armor plate slid shut, obscuring everything.

Time: 9 minutes 30 seconds after the final whistle
Location: Altitude 500 kilometers, jump threshold
Blue light swelled.
Spacetime around the Scimitar-class frigate warped—light stretching, spiraling into an all-consuming vortex. The FTL drive's hum, even through vacuum and hull, resonated in the marrow.
Wanderer's thruster overheat alarms went mad.
Lev silenced them.
ARG military warning broadcasts stopped.
The Behemoth-class gun shrouds reclosed.
Corona remained silent as mountains.
Mission accomplished—monitoring, deterrence. The outcome seemed irrelevant.
He looked at the screen one last time—the red dot representing the Scimitar-class fading from physical universe coordinates, sliding toward another dimension. In seconds, it would vanish completely.
And these pursuers would remain, floating in silence, fuel exhausted, dragged back by ARG patrol ships (perhaps dispatched by those very Behemoths), fined, detained, filed.
Foolish.
Utterly meaningless.
But.
Lev opened all-frequency broadcast.
Not for TER. Not for ARG military. For those behind him—the dozen-plus civilian ships still desperately thrusting forward. For Old Joe, Mara, for everyone who chose foolishness tonight.
He said nothing.
Just pressed a key.
From the ship's speakers flowed audio—old format, heavily compressed, riddled with noise. But clear enough.
A woman's voice, young, warm:
"This is Antigone Aurora Dome public broadcast. Star date NT 741, day 187. Weather clear, temperature pleasant. Remember, no matter where you go, home always waits among the stars. Have a beautiful day."
Leia's voice.
She'd been the dome's announcer. This recording—Lev had excavated it from ruin data, the last complete archive.
The audio flowed through the channel.
A dozen ships fell silent simultaneously.
Only that long-vanished woman's voice echoed through vacuum and steel, gently, stubbornly, defying the blue light consuming everything ahead, wrapping around those silent black giants behind.
The Scimitar-class vanished.
Blue light contracted to a point. Then—nothing.
Silence.
Only that cold, persistent sense of surveillance from high orbit remained, like thorns in the back.
Lev killed the engines.
Wanderer lost thrust, drifting on momentum. He slumped in his seat, gasping, sweat soaking through his shirt.
On the channel, Old Joe spoke first, voice exhausted: "...Going home?"
"Yeah," Mara said, seeming to glance at the massive shadow above. "Going home."
No celebration.
No grand declarations.
Only exhaustion, and a hollowness after being scrutinized by greater powers.
Lev turned the ship around, looking back—Argon Prime's blue arc hung in darkness, the stadium's location still showing scattered fires.
More vivid than the fires: three Behemoths suspended above the planet's curve like black crosses, and behind them, Corona's massive form seeming to absorb all light. Still there. Guarding. Imprisoning.
He remembered that TER player's wave.
Not a victor's gesture.
More like... a weary acknowledgment. Acknowledging this chase. Acknowledging this silent send-off. Acknowledging that some things even FTL drives can't shake off.
Also acknowledging that between civilian rage and fleeing victors, there stood even more massive, more silent, inscrutable third-party forces.
Like memory.
Like hatred.
Like an announcer's blessing on a clear day.
Like the homeland's sword suspended overhead.
"Lev," Mara asked softly, voice carrying post-crisis emptiness, "did we catch up?"
Lev looked at the navigation screen.
The red dot representing the Scimitar-class had indeed disappeared.
But on screen, all the pursuit ships' trajectories had been auto-connected by the system into a single line—a line stabbing out from the planet's surface, pointing straight into deep space.
This line pierced through ARG fleet's silent surveillance net, pointed toward where the enemy fled, then terminated powerlessly in the void.
An arrow.
That missed its mark.
That flew anyway.
And was completely recorded by the eyes of Behemoth and Corona.
"We caught up," he said.
Voice soft, yet extraordinarily clear.
Everyone on the channel heard.
Perhaps those lofty "eyes" also "heard."
He pushed the controls. Wanderer slowly turned toward the planet, toward the fine, toward his daughter's probable reproach, toward tomorrow with neither trophy nor answers.
Also toward those steel heavens of homeland still suspended in orbit, hanging silent as divine judgment.
But on the return route, he replayed that recording over and over.
Leia's voice looped in the cockpit:
"No matter where you go, home always waits among the stars."
Outside, stars hung silent.
The massive warship shadow slowly slid across the viewport overhead, briefly blocking starlight, casting deep darkness, then moving on.
But Lev felt that tonight, they sounded different.
Home waits among the stars,
yet among those stars also hang the cold steel and unblinking eyes of home.

END
