The Send-Off — A X4 Fan-Fiction: Civilian Defiance in the Terran–Argon Conflict

​

Author's Notes

⭐ Setting & Intent
This fan-fiction takes place in the X4: Foundations universe. It focuses on a perspective grand strategy games rarely portray: the civilians who endure the consequences of our "optimal" fleet commands.
It is about quiet defiance, not battlefield triumph.

⭐ Background — The Antigone Wound (Custom AU)
In my own playthrough, I once ordered a Terran fleet to "glass" the Antigone Memorial sector.
In this AU, that event became the AGI Purification Initiative, a Terran sovereignty action that shattered the Argon/Antigone heartland and turned it into an occupied zone haunted by the dead.
Antigone is not just a sector — it is a fresh wound.

⭐ The Spark — The "Blood-Stained" Football Match
Only 47 days after Antigone fell, Argon Prime hosted the Commonwealth FA Cup Final: ARG vs TER.
Mockery, grief, and anger turned the stadium into a second battlefield.
TER won 2:1.
The evacuation began.
The suppressed fury of the Argon people finally broke.
This is where "The Send-Off" begins.

⭐ Technical Notes (For X4/VRO Readers)
To emphasize the power gap between Terran warships and civilian scavengers, I incorporated:

- VRO's Corona-class battleship
- A reintroduced X3-style Jump Drive

These elements serve emotional and thematic function, not just tech flavor.

⭐ About the "New Antigone" Series
The Send-Off is part of a larger narrative cluster originally written in Chinese.
Each entry examines the same geopolitical disaster through different literary lenses, including:

- A prequel, written in documentary style about the FA Cup Final itself
- A Terran player's mother POV, navigating fear, loyalty, and the fallout of victory
- A streamer's perspective, presented as a realtime broadcast / chat-log narrative

Currently, only "The Send-Off" has been translated into English.

Original Chinese version (with full authorial phrasing) is available here:

[H2]Story[/H2]

Time: 3 minutes after the final whistle
Location: "Free Port" Station outskirts, salvage sector

The alarm was red.
Not in color, but in shape—sharp, staccato, slicing through eardrums. Lev Kovach jolted awake in the Wanderer's pilot seat, drool still clinging to his chin. He'd been fixing the thrusters until four in the morning.

The terminal window auto-popped.

Breaking: GFU confirms—TER 2:1 ARG. Mass violence erupts at stadium. TER team emergency evacuation underway.

The words: ice.
What they ignited in Lev's gut: fire.

He was fifty—left knee scarred from old wounds, right ear half-deaf since an explosion during the Gate Closure. In his years he'd piloted cargo haulers, towed ice chunks, even worked three months under SCA pirates (something he never told his daughter). But never—never like now—

Staring at that line "TER team emergency evacuation," his fingers clenched into fists without permission.

Nails bit into palms.
Pain.
Good. Still felt pain. Not a dream.

The channel from the adjacent berth exploded with voices.

Old Joe's rasp, like sandpaper grinding iron:

[QUOTE]
"They win the game, trash the venue, and now they just walk away?"
[/QUOTE]

Mara—the navigator who kept adding new star charts to her arm tattoos—voice trembling:

[QUOTE]
"Spaceport's locked down. All civilian traffic grounded. But the military port… there's a ship warming up."
[/QUOTE]

Lev said nothing.

He pulled up the last frame from the public surveillance feed—beyond the stadium dome, a sleek gray shadow was turning. Falx-class. M-type. The two escorting Nova+ had already lit their vector thrusters.

A withdrawal with contingency plans already in place.
Or rather, the closing ceremony of a humiliation.

But at the frame's edge, something else lurked.

Higher in orbit, several silent black silhouettes nearly merged with the starfield. Only occasional attitude adjustments—brief blue glows from thrusters—betrayed their presence. ARG Behemoth-class destroyers. No lights, no movement. Just hanging there like mourners at a funeral vigil.

And deeper still, in the space they guarded, an even more massive shadow loomed—swallowing starlight itself.

Corona.

Lev's throat went dry.
The capital's guardian, now gazing coldly down.

[QUOTE]
"They're about to jump," Old Joe said. "Straight from military port to orbit. Ten minutes from now, they won't even see our atmosphere."
[/QUOTE]

Three seconds of silence.

Then Mara, softly:

[QUOTE]
"My daughter was at the stadium. She said… someone raised the ANT flag."
[/QUOTE]

Lev closed his eyes.

He saw Sandra—not the twenty-six-year-old data engineer now, but the seven-year-old curled in his arms asking:

[QUOTE]
"Dad, what's Antigone?"
[/QUOTE]

He'd said then:

[QUOTE]
"It's a place."
[/QUOTE]

What he didn't say:
It's also a wound.

"Lev?" Old Joe asked. "You get that thruster fixed?"

Fixed.

At midnight he'd replaced blades with black-market scrap. During test fire the hull nearly seized. But—it could fly.

"Fixed," he said.
Too calm. Too still.

"Then what are we waiting for?" Mara asked.

Lev opened his eyes. Looked at the photo taped on the cockpit wall—him and Leia, young, smiling, in front of a Theseus-class cargo bay door and the aurora dome of Antigone Memorial Sector.

Photo taken NT 841.
Dome destroyed NT 864.
Leia died somewhere between.

"Not waiting," he said.
"Not anymore."

Time: 6 minutes after the final whistle
Location: Argon Prime low orbit, unauthorized launch corridor C-7

The Wanderer shrieked breaking atmosphere.

Not metaphorically. The composite armor truly screamed under heating—high-frequency and animal. Lev ignored every warning and slammed the thrust to maximum.

Inertia crushed him.
His spine lit with fracture-sharp pain.
But his eyes locked on the map—

Red dot: the Falx-class frigate, acceleration smooth as silk.
Two smaller red dots: escort fighters.
Green dot: him.
A tortoise chasing a missile.

Absurd.

But the backdrop was more absurd.

Three Behemoths repositioned with slow dignity.
Not intercepting TER.
Not protecting civilians.
Simply observing.

And the massive Corona remained motionless—a monolith.

[QUOTE]
"Lev, I'm at your ten o'clock," Old Joe called. "Mara's caught up. And Black Rock's lunatics brought three ships."
[/QUOTE]

Voices erupted—Theseus freighters, Hades, even a gutted Minotaur turned into a thruster brick. No commander. No plan. Just ships launching like sparks from a steel grinder.

Then ARG traffic control cut in:

[QUOTE]
"Unauthorized ascending vessels—this is Argon Prime orbital control. Cease heading immediately. Behemoth-3 will conduct deterrent scanning."
[/QUOTE]

A scan beam swept across their hulls—cold and measuring.

"Keep chasing?" Mara asked, trembling.

"Can't catch up," Lev said.

He checked the data:
Falx cruising speed: ×2.3 his own.
FTL spool: 4 minutes.
Civilians: no jump drives.

[QUOTE]
"Then why chase?"
[/QUOTE]

Lev zoomed in.
The Swift Blade—pristine gray hull, red sun emblem—hadn't even armed shields.

Indifference: the worst humiliation.
Powerlessness: when your own fleet must restrain you.

[QUOTE]
"Because they need to know," Lev said. "Know someone's watching. Someone remembers."
[/QUOTE]

Time: 8 minutes after the final whistle
Location: 420km altitude, loose arrowhead pursuit

TER broadcast:

[QUOTE]
"Change heading or face attack."
[/QUOTE]

ARG broadcast:

[QUOTE]
"Final warning!"
[/QUOTE]

Trapped between enemy ahead, guardians behind.

No one turned back.

The Falx's FTL ring glowed blue.

Behemoths' gun shrouds opened—target unclear. Lev felt hunted by giants.

He switched to private channel.
A preset message.
To Sandra.

[QUOTE]
"Sandra, if you're reading this, I did something stupid… Antigone isn't 'a place.' It's part of us."
[/QUOTE]

Send.
Lightness.

"Lev!" Mara shouted.

An armor plate on the Falx slid open—an observation window.

Behind it—a young TER player, leaning into glass, watching them.

No grin.
No mockery.
Just… watching.

Then he raised a hand.

Not salute.
Not taunt.
Just a wave.

Farewell.
Acknowledgment.

Behind them, Corona subtly rotated turret clusters—like a beast shifting beneath mountains of steel—then froze again.

The window sealed.

Time: 9m 30s after the final whistle
Location: 500km altitude, jump threshold

Blue light swelled.
Space warped.
The Falx hummed through marrow.

ARG warnings ceased.
Behemoth shrouds closed.
Corona remained silent.

Lev opened all-freq broadcast.
Not to TER.
Not to ARG.
To the civilians behind.

He pressed play.

A woman's warm voice, noisy and old:

[QUOTE]
"This is Antigone Aurora Dome public broadcast… No matter where you go, home always waits among the stars."
[/QUOTE]

Leia's voice.

Silence across a dozen ships.

Then—
Jump.
Blue collapsed to a point.
Gone.

Old Joe:

[QUOTE]
"…Going home?"
[/QUOTE]

Mara:

[QUOTE]
"Yeah. Going home."
[/QUOTE]

Lev turned back toward fines, scolding, tomorrow.

On the nav screen the system auto-connected their trajectories into a line—

An arrow
shooting out from the planet,
through the surveillance net,
toward the void,
then dying there.

[QUOTE]
"Did we catch up?"
[/QUOTE]

Lev watched the empty space.

[QUOTE]
"We caught up," he said.
[/QUOTE]

He replayed Leia's voice:

[QUOTE]
"Home waits among the stars."
[/QUOTE]

But in those stars lingered cold steel and unblinking eyes of home.

END
