[SIZE=5][B]I. Pre-Match: Opening Ceremony on a Powder Keg[/B][/SIZE]

14:00. The TER Earth National Team's pristine white transport bus rolled through the megacity gates.
It was greeted by 120,000 ARG voices, fused into a single roar:
[B]"MURDERERS! GO BACK TO EARTH!"[/B]
[B]"ANTIGONE'S BLOOD WILL NOT BE SPILLED IN VAIN!"[/B]

From the northwest corner—the Cauldron, ARG's hardcore ultra section—a 50-meter holographic banner unfurled in slow, deliberate motion:
Footage of the ARG destroyer Defender Commemoration erupting into an expanding fireball, its hull folding like paper under Terran singularity fire.
Below, in letters that seemed to drip molten steel:
"THEY DESTROYED OUR SHIP — TODAY WE DESTROY THEIR PRIDE"

The TER supporter zone—3,000 strong, boxed behind triple-layer anti-riot energy shields, two meters of transparent armor, and 500 Boron arbitrators—responded with synchronized military claps.
Precise. Rhythmic. Like a firing squad counting down.
They raised flags bearing the Earth-Luna Ring insignia. One banner stood out:
"ORDER HAS ARRIVED — COURTESY OF THE 7TH FLEET"

The First Flashpoint: The Moment of Silence
GFU protocol called for 30 seconds of silence "for all casualties of the campaign."
The announcement echoed through the dome.
Then—
ARG captain Marcus Thorn reached into his kit bag and pulled out a black mourning armband, hand-stitched with a torn pale-blue ANT national flag.
Every ARG player dropped to one knee.
Pointed at the TER bench.
Roared in unison:
"MURDERERS DON'T DESERVE TO PLAY FOOTBALL!"

TER captain Karl Schneider—whose brother served as weapons officer aboard the 7th Fleet ship Unyielding Will—smirked.
He raised his hand.
Made a slow, deliberate "handgun" gesture at the camera.
Tapped his temple.
[I]Click.[/I]
The stadium erupted.
GFU officials scrambled to restore order, threatening immediate disqualification for further disruptions.
The match kicked off under a sky thick with tension—and the faint chemical tang of riot-control aerosols already being prepped in the tunnels.

[SIZE=5][B]II. First Half: Brutal Football[/B][/SIZE]

[B]3' — First Blood (Yellow Card)[/B]
ARG midfielder Rico—whose cousin died on the Defender Commemoration—launched a flying tackle into TER playmaker Yuuki Kobayashi.
Metal studs scraped across Kobayashi's knee, tearing fabric and skin.
Kobayashi screamed, clutching his leg as TER medics sprinted onto the pitch.
The ARG crowd cheered: "SCHNEIDER IS NEXT!"
VAR ruled it a yellow card. Rico stood, spat on the turf, and bared his teeth at the TER bench: "THAT'S INTEREST FOR SANDWELL ARCHIVES!"

[B]28' — The Schneider Incident[/B]
Schneider burst into the ARG box. Defender Amir—Antigone-born, family still missing in the rubble—glued to his shoulder.
Slow-motion replay showed: Schneider touches the ball first; Amir's hand clearly pulls his arm; Schneider, as he falls, slams his left hand into Amir's ankle—a vicious, hidden strike.
Amir collapsed, howling in pain.
Schneider rolled once, sprang to his feet, and screamed at the referee, arms raised high: "PENALTY! CLEAR FOUL!"

During the 6-minute VAR wait:
ARG stands: 37,000 voices in the Cauldron sang "Antigone Shall Never Fall"—a naval war hymn.
Red and blue flares ignited across the upper tiers, smoke curling toward the dome ceiling like funeral pyres.
TER stands: Laser projections spelled out: "TECH WINS, ALWAYS". Synchronized clapping resumed—tap-tap-TAP.

Final VAR ruling: "Amir — foul. Penalty to TER. Schneider — simulation and retaliation. Yellow card."
ARG exploded. Goalkeeper Greaves sprinted upfield and punched the VAR monitor, shattering the screen. Marcus Thorn jammed his finger into the referee's faceplate: "YOU ERIDANI TAKING TERRAN GOLD?!"
ARG head coach stormed onto the pitch, face purple with rage: "DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY CHILDREN A SINGULARITY WEAPON KILLS?! DO YOU?!"

Match suspended: 12 minutes.
Schneider buried the penalty. TER 1–0 ARG.
As he jogged back, he tapped his temple again—click—then blew a kiss at the Cauldron.

[B]41' — Detonation[/B]
Down a goal, ARG's discipline shattered.
43' — Rico slammed Schneider from behind, sending both players sprawling.
The tackle turned into a full fistfight on the turf. Both benches charged.
TER assistant coach—a former Marine—dropped an ARG physio with a tactical flashlight strike to the temple.
Schneider stood, face streaming blood from a broken nose, and laughed into the broadcast camera: "Fragile—just like your Behemoth-class."

Halftime screen flickered—hacked for 3 seconds: "SANDWELL STILL BURNS AND YOU'RE PLAYING FOOTBALL?"

[B]Commentator: Jericho Rax (voice shredded, trembling with rage)[/B]
"LOOK—(voice cracks)—look at that smug bastard's FACE! You see that smile? That's not a footballer—that's a butcher parading in shorts!
Schneider dives, gets the call, and mocks us. TER uses singularity weapons to vaporize our destroyers, electronic warfare to blind our fleets, and now theatrics to blind the GFU!
Referees—do you really not see it? Or is this like TER's 'necessary order' in Antigone—now a 'necessary call'?!
(breathing hard)
This trophy—this Commonwealth Cup—has been passed down for three centuries. Three hundred years! Our grandfathers lifted it when the gates still connected us to the whole galaxy.
And now? Now these invaders—these butchers who cut Antigone from the map—dare to touch it with the same hands that vaporized our brothers?!
(voice breaking)
The trophy doesn't belong to them. It never will. Even if they win today, history will remember this as theft, not triumph!"

[B]Guest Analyst: Elena (former ANT Navy officer, voice choking)[/B]
"I served aboard the Defender Commemoration. I know the names of the crew who died in that fireball. Twenty-three of them were younger than Schneider.
(pause, struggling for composure)
They died in cold vacuum. Bodies lost. No funerals. No graves.
And now TER players—wearing Earth-Luna insignia—celebrate on our soil...
(voice rising suddenly, furious)
But hear me—Antigone isn't dead! Our resistance has begun—on every occupied street, in every surveilled network, in every heart that refuses to forget!"

[B]Commentator: Miyuki Nakamura (voice clinical, emotionless—like reading a combat report)[/B]
[I]"Replay analysis: contact confirmed. Pulling motion: clear. Ruling: procedurally sound.
ARG emotional breakdown reflects systemic failure. Undisciplined. Sentiment-driven. Unable to accept that higher-efficiency systems inevitably prevail.
Schneider continues despite injury. Resilience quotient: acceptable for TER military offspring standards."[/I]

[B]Military Analyst: Retired TER Major Hideo Tanaka[/B]
"This mirrors battlefield dynamics precisely.
ARG–ANT coalition relied on 'homeland defense morale'—emotion as tactical fuel. Result: rapid collapse when facing precision doctrine and tech superiority.
Now ARG players attempt identical strategy: passion over technique. Outcome: fouls, loss of control, inevitable defeat.
(pause)
Football is simply another battlespace dimension. The result was never in question."

[SIZE=5][B]IV. Second Half — From Match to Riot[/B][/SIZE]

[B]67' — The Equalizer[/B]
ARG striker Marcus Thorn finally broke through. 1–1.
He sprinted toward the TER stands, ripped off his jersey mid-run—underneath: a white T-shirt with a massive ANT national flag and handwritten text: [B]"YOU CAN OCCUPY OUR STARS, BUT NOT OUR MEMORY"[/B]
Laser pointers erupted from the TER section—dozens of high-intensity beams spearing his eyes.
Thorn stumbled, half-blind, as security tackled him. But even on the ground, he screamed: "ANTIGONE! ANTIGONE! ANTIGONE!"
120,000 voices answered: "ANTIGONE! ANTIGONE! ANTIGONE!"

[B]89' — The Dagger[/B]
TER counterattack. Schneider threaded a perfect through-ball to substitute forward Miller—19 years old, son of the 7th Fleet Scythe bomber wing commander.
Miller slotted it past the keeper. TER 2–1 ARG.
Miller ran to the corner flag. Raised both arms. Mimed a bomber releasing payload. Then snapped a perfect TER military salute at the ARG stands.
The Cauldron went silent. Not from fear. From the kind of rage that stops making sound.

[SIZE=5][B]V. Final Whistle — Hell Opens[/B][/SIZE]

[B]90'+6 — The Whistle Blows. TER wins 2–1.[/B]

[B]Tunnel Brawl:[/B] Rico led a charge toward the TER changing room corridor. Players, coaches, security tangled into a chaotic melee. Broadcast caught: TER assistant coach dropping an ARG medic; ARG goalkeeper strangling a TER kitman.

[B]Stands War:[/B] ARG ultras activated a homemade EMP device, collapsing one section of the energy shield. Fans poured through, clashing with the Boron riot line.
[B]TER Section:[/B] Smoke grenades and flash-bangs were hurled. One ARG teenager—13 years old—was pulled into the TER zone and beaten bloody. His lips still moving, whispering: "Antigone... Antigone..."

[B]City Spillover:[/B] Halo District bars erupted into ARG–TER street fights. Three hover police cruisers torched. Parliament building walls were spray-painted: "LOSE THE MATCH TODAY, LOSE PRIME TOMORROW"

[SIZE=5][B]VI. Casualties & Aftermath[/B][/SIZE]

[B]Official Tally:[/B] 37 seriously injured, 218 arrests, 1 fatality (ARG fan, 58, cardiac arrest).
[B]Political Fallout:[/B] TER demands accountability for "violent ethno-nationalism." ARG Senate responds: "TER players glorified an invasion. If the GFU will not act, we will remember."

[B]The Viral Clip:[/B]
As the TER team armored vehicle convoy departed under heavy escort, a group of ARG teenagers stood silently by the roadside. No rocks thrown. No insults. Just twelve pairs of eyes—burning with cold hatred.
One boy raised a hand. Not a wave. Not a salute. Just... [B]pointing[/B]. Marking them.

[SIZE=5][B]VII. Post-Match Analysis: The Autopsy of a Nation[/B][/SIZE]

This wasn't football. It was the Antigone Campaign's emotional critical mass, detonating in 90 minutes.

When Schneider tapped his temple—click
When Thorn tore off his jersey and screamed "ANTIGONE!"
When the ARG Cauldron fell silent with rage too deep for sound
When that thirteen-year-old boy whispered "Antigone" through a shattered face

Everyone understood: The war beyond the jump gate never ended. [B]It merely changed containers.[/B]
