## **I. Pre-Match: Opening Ceremony on a Powder Keg**

At 14:00, when the TER Earth National Team’s pure-white transport bus entered the megacity, it was met by a tidal roar from 120,000 ARG fans:

> **“Murderers! Go back to Earth!”**
> **“Antigone’s blood will not be spilled in vain!”**

From the northwest stands, a 50-meter holo-banner unfurled—footage of the ARG destroyer *Defender Commemoration* erupting into an expanding fireball. Below, in burning letters:

> **“They destroyed our ship—today we destroy their pride.”**

The TER supporter zone (3,000 strong) was boxed behind triple-layer anti-riot energy shields, two meters of transparent armor, and 500 Boron riot arbitrators. Their response came in synchronized military claps as they raised flags bearing the Earth-Luna Ring insignia, including one that read:

> **“Order Has Arrived — Courtesy of the 7th Fleet.”**

The scheduled moment of silence became the first flashpoint:

GFU organizers called for **30 seconds of silence “for all casualties of the campaign.”**

ARG captain **Marcus Thorn** suddenly produced a black mourning armband embroidered with a torn pale-blue ANT national flag.

Every ARG player dropped to one knee, pointed at the TER bench, and roared in unison:

> **“Murderers don’t deserve to play football!”**

TER captain, striker **Karl Schneider**—whose brother served as weapons officer aboard the 7th Fleet ship *Unyielding Will*—smirked and made a “handgun” gesture at the camera, tapping his temple.

The match kicked off only after GFU issued a hard warning: **“Further disruptions will result in disqualification.”**

## **II. Match Progress: 90 Minutes of War**

### **First Half (0’–25’): Brutal Football**

3’ — ARG midfielder **Rico** (whose cousin died on the *Defender Commemoration*) launched a flying tackle into TER playmaker **Yuuki Kobayashi**, metal studs scraping his knee.

Kobayashi screamed on the turf. When TER medics rushed in, the ARG crowd **cheered**:

> **“Schneider is next!”**

VAR ruled it a yellow. Rico stood, bared his teeth at the TER bench, and yelled:

> **“That’s interest for the Sandwell Archives!”**

---

### **Controversy (28’): Penalty? Simulation? Both?**

Schneider burst into the box with ARG defender **Amir** (an Antigone-born Argon) glued to him. Slow-motion showed:

* Schneider touches the ball first
* Amir clearly pulls his arm
* But Schneider, as he falls, slams his left hand into Amir’s ankle—deliberately

Amir howled in pain while Schneider demanded a penalty.

The Eridani referee spent **6 full minutes** at VAR.

During the review:

* ARG stands sang **“Antigone Shall Never Fall”** like a war anthem
* TER fans projected **“Technological Superiority = Justice”** in laser script
* Seats and debris started flying across the stand edge

Final ruling: **Amir foul first — Penalty to TER.**
But Schneider’s retaliation earned a **yellow card.**

ARG exploded:

* Their goalkeeper punched the VAR monitor
* Thorn jabbed his finger into the referee’s face:

  > **“You Eridani taking TER money too?!”**
* ARG head coach (whose son is an ANT naval pilot) stormed the pitch:

  > **“Do you know how many children a singularity weapon kills?!”**

Match suspended for **12 minutes**.

Schneider buried the penalty. **TER 1–0 ARG.**

### **41’: Detonation**

Down a goal, ARG utterly lost control.

43’ — Rico slammed Schneider from behind; both rolled into a full fistfight.

Both benches charged the pitch.
Boron arbitrators deployed **non-lethal sonic suppressors** to separate them.

Schneider stood up, face streaming blood (later confirmed broken nasal bone), and snarled into the lens:

> **“Fragile—just like your Behemoth-class.”**

At halftime, the stadium screen flickered—hacked for **3 seconds**:

> **“Sandwell still burns and you’re playing football?”**

Feed cut instantly.

## **III. Two Commentaries — Two Propaganda Machines**

### **ARG Federal Sports Channel (Rage Incarnate)**

Commentator **Jericho Rax**, voice shredded:

> “Look at Schneider’s face! Look at that smug celebration after the simulation! Is this football?! No—this is TER mocking our entire nation! They used singularity weapons to vaporize our destroyers, electronic warfare to blind our missiles, and now theatrics to blind the GFU!
> Referees—do you really not see it? Or is this like TER’s ‘necessary order’ in Antigone—now a ‘necessary call’?!”

Guest analyst, former ANT Navy officer **Elena** (choking up):

> “I served aboard the *Defender Commemoration*. My comrades… they died in cold vacuum, bodies lost forever. And now TER players, wearing Earth-Luna insignia, celebrate on our soil… I cannot describe this grief.
> (voice rising) But hear me—Antigone isn’t dead! Our resistance has begun—on every occupied street, in every surveilled network!”

---

### **TER National Sports Channel (Ice-Cold Brutalism)**

Commentator **Miyuki Nakamura**, voice clinical like an ops briefing:

> “Objective replay shows clear pulling. The ruling was correct. ARG’s emotional breakdown reflects their society: undisciplined, enslaved to sentiment, and unable to accept that higher-efficiency systems inevitably prevail. Schneider continues despite injury, showing the resilience expected of TER military offspring.”

Military analyst, retired TER Major:

> “This perfectly mirrors battlefield dynamics. The ARG–ANT coalition relied on ‘defend the homeland’ emotional morale, but collapsed when facing precision tactics and a tech gap. Their players now attempt the same with ‘passion over technique,’ resulting only in fouls and loss of control. Football is simply another battlespace dimension.”

## **IV. Second Half: From Match to Riot**

### **Turning Point (67’)**

ARG striker **Marcus Thorn** finally equalized.

He sprinted toward the TER stands, ripped off his jersey—revealing an ANT flag tee with:

> **“You can occupy our stars, but not our memory!”**

Laser pointers speared his eyes from the TER section.

Security tackled him as he screamed into the cameras:

> **“Antigone! Antigone! Antigone!”**

120,000 fans echoed the chant—vibrations humming through anti-riot glass.

---

### **89’: Total Breakdown**

TER struck with a counterattack: **2–1 TER**

Scorer was 19-year-old **Miller**, son of the TER 7th Fleet **Scythe** bomber wing commander.

He ran to the corner flag, mimed **a bomber releasing payload**, then snapped a perfect TER military salute at the ARG stands.

---

### **Final Whistle: Hell Opens**

**Tunnel Brawl**

* Rico led a charge toward the TER changing room
* Players, coaches, and security tangled in a chaotic melee
* Broadcast cameras caught a TER assistant coach (former Marine) dropping an ARG medic with a tactical flashlight strike

**Stands War**

* ARG ultras used a homemade **EMP device** to briefly disable the energy shield
* TER fans deployed smoke and flash grenades (later confirmed **non-lethal military issue**)
* ARG fans broke barriers and clashed with Boron arbitrators
* TER supporters were dragged out and beaten—**first visible blood on camera**

**City Spillover**

* Bars around the megacity erupted into ARG–TER street fights
* Three hover police cruisers were torched
* Parliament walls were tagged:

  > **“Lose the match today, lose Prime tomorrow.”**

---

## **V. Casualties & Aftershocks**

**Official Tally (wildly understated):**

* **37 seriously injured** (including 2 players)
* **218 arrests**
* Stadium damages: **85 million credits**

**Political Fallout:**

TER Foreign Ministry condemned **“ARG’s indulgence of violent nationalism endangering TER citizens.”**

ARG Senate hardliners replied:

> **“TER’s militaristic provocation on the field glorifies an invasion.”**

GFU declared an **indefinite suspension** of all ARG–TER fixtures.

But the real verdict came online:

> **#TheSecondBattleground**
> hit #1 trending across the star network.

A viral clip showed the TER team bus departing as a group of silent ARG teenagers stood by the road—holding a ragged ANT flag splattered with red paint.

No rocks thrown.
No insults.

Just **twelve pairs of eyes, burning with cold hatred far older than their faces.**

---

## **Post-Match Summary**

This wasn’t football.

It was the **Antigone Campaign’s emotional critical mass**, detonating in 90 minutes.

TER’s **sterile efficiency** and ARG’s **desperate grief** completed a full cycle—from political narrative to physical violence.

When Schneider laughed through the blood—
When Thorn exposed the ANT flag—
When smoke blurred the stands like it blurred the VAR screen—

Everyone understood:

The war beyond the jump gate never ended.

It merely **changed venue**.

Anywhere ARG and TER coexist,
the conflict **resumes**.

And the final whistle will never truly sound—

Because once hatred reaches critical density,
it **finds a new container.**

Today it was a football pitch.

Tomorrow?

No one knows.
